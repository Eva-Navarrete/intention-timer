## Overview and Project Goals
The [goal](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/intention-timer-group.html) of this solo project I did for Mod1 at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/) is to build a Intention Timer from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript.

## Why was this project created?
To solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:
1. writing clean and DRY HTML, CSS, and JS
2. understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
3. the interaction between multiple class files
4. implementation of client-side data persistence by utilizing JSON and localStorage
